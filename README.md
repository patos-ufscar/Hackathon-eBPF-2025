## Overview
Our **eBPF Scheduler** levereges **eBPF** and **sched_ext** to prioritize Kubernetes cgroups by their **PID** with a simple TUI. This project provides a proof of concept of eBPF's use for creating custom Schedulers and its potential use for allocating priority and cpu resources to the desired kubernetes cgroup.

## Features
- Prioritize Kubernetes cgroups based on their PID.
- Uses eBPF and sched_ext to make a custom Linux scheduler.
